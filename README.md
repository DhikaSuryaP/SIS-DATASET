# Quantifying the Health–Economy Trade-Offs: Mathematical Model of COVID-19 Pandemic Dynamics

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a complex situation that requires a balance between control measures like lockdowns and easing restrictions. Control measures can limit the spread of the virus but can also cause economic and social issues. Easing restrictions can support economic recovery but may increase the risk of virus transmission. Mathematical approaches can help address these trade-offs by modeling the interactions between factors such as virus transmission rates, public health interventions, and economic and social impacts. A study using a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model with modified discrete time was conducted to determine the cost of handling COVID-19. The results showed that, without government intervention, the number of patients rejected by health facilities and the cost of handling a pandemic increased significantly. Lockdown intervention provided the least number of rejected patients compared to social distancing, but the costs of handling the pandemic in the lockdown scenario remained higher than those of social distancing. This research demonstrates that mathematical approaches can help identify critical junctures in a pandemic, such as limited health system capacity or high transmission rates, that require rapid response and appropriate action. By using mathematical analysis, decision-makers can develop more effective and responsive strategies, considering the various factors involved in the virus’s spread and its impact on society and the economy.
